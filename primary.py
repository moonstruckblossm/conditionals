# Conditions & Conditionals

# 1 - Conditions
print('\n' + 'Task 1' + '\n')
# Part 1 is focused on getting input from the user and comparing that input in various ways.
#
# Instructions:
#   a. Prompt input in the form of a float from the user and save to four variables: a, b, c, and d.
#       --> a has been done for you already. Feel free to change the prompt if you wish.
#   b. Print the results of the following comparisons. Number 1 has been done for you.
#       1. a == b
#       2. a == b == c
#       3. a > b > c
#       4. a < b < c < d
#       5. a != b == c != d
#       6. a >= b >= c == d
#       7. a <= b > c <= d
#
# WRITE CODE BELOW #
a = float(input('a = '))
b =
c =
d =

print('a == b |', a == b)

# 2 - if Statements (ONLY USE if STATEMENTS)
print('\n' + 'Task 2' + '\n')
# Instructions:
#   a. Prompt input from the user in the form of a word, and save to a variable. Do this twice. It has been done
#       for the first word, you must do the second one yourself.
#
#   b. Write the following conditionals using ONLY if Statements:
#       1. Compare the words to see if they are the same. If so, print that they are the same.
#
#       2. Compare the words to see if they aren't the same. If so, print that they are not the same.
#
#       3. Compare the words to see if word1 is alphabetically lower (less than) than word2. If so, print that
#           the first word appears before the second word.
#
#       4. Compare the words to see if word1 is alphabetically higher (greater than) than word2. If so, print that
#           the first word appears after the second word.
#
# WRITE CODE BELOW #
word1 = input('enter a word: ')
word2 =

if word1 == word2:
    print(word1, 'and', word2, 'are the same!')


# 3 - if-elif-else Statements
print('\n' + 'Task 3' + '\n')
# Instructions:
#   a. Using the randint function, roll two six sided dice. One dice has been rolled for you already.
#
#   b. Write the following using if-elif-else Statements:
#       1. If both dice are the same value, print 'Doubles!' followed by the two numbers. However, if the numbers
#           are both ones, print 'Snake Eyes!' instead.
#
#       2. If both dice are even, print 'Evens!' followed by the two numbers.
#
#       3. If both dice are odd, print 'Odds!' followed by the two numbers.
#
#       4. If the sum of the values of the dice are greater than 6, print 'Win!'
#
#       5. Otherwise, print 'Lose!'
#
# WRITE CODE BELOW #
dice1 = randint(1, 6)
